      <h1>Billy Collins</h1>
      <p><b>Full name (as well as any pen names used).</b> Billy Collins</p>
      <p><b>Place and date of birth.</b> March 22nd 1941</p>
      <p><b>Where the poet grew up (and what might have impacted his/her work).</b> He grew up in Queens in New York with a mother who induced in him a "love of words" (Wikipedia) This likely induced him to go into poetry and writing.</p>
      <p><b>What made this poet want to write poetry?</b> See above</p>
      <p><b>What movement (or schools of poetry) was s/he involved with?</b> This poet breaks with the traditional style of rhymes and talking about romantic things, and instead talks about real life&#8482; in a free-verse manner. This is consistent with (post)modernism.</p>
      <p><b>Why is this poet famous (or why wasn't s/he)?</b> yes</p>
      <p><b>What are the poet's most important pieces?</b> One often mention poem by this author is one that he wrote upon request of congress after 9/11.</p>
      <p><b>Was s/he friends with other poets (or influenced by other poets)?</b> My research has come up with nothing in particular saying he was around other poets, but he is a professor at a university, likely in a department with other poets.</p>
      <p><b>Was s/he famous during his/her lifetime?</b> "Billy Collins is famous for conversational, witty poems that welcome readers with humor but often slip into quirky, tender or profound observation on the everyday, reading and writing, and poetry itself."
        "Though Collins published throughout the 1980s, it was his fourth book, Questions about Angels (1991), that propelled him into the literary spotlight. The collection was selected by poet Ed Hirsch for the 1990 National Poetry Series."</p>
