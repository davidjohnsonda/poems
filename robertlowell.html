      <h1>Robert Lowell</h1>
      <p><b>Full Name:</b> Robert Traill Spence Lowell IV</p>
      <p><b>Date of Birth:</b> March 1st 1917</p>
      <p><b>Place of growing up:</b><br> He grew up in Boston, and this is considered to have influenced his poetry significantly, with his early poetry mythologising Boston and New England. Furthermore, his family cared about ancestry to a great degree, and this influenced his poetry.</p>
      <p><b>What made this poet want to write poetry?</b><br>In high school another famous poet, Richard Eberhart, was a teacher of poetry. This induced Lowell to decide to dedicate his life to poetry.</p>
      <p><b>What movement (or schools of poetry) was s/he involved with?</b><br> Although he is a confessional poet, he did not fit into the standard form of this movement, and experimented with multiple styles throughout his life.</p>
      <p><b>Why is this poet famous (or why wasn't s/he)?</b><br> He won an award for his first poetry book that said "featured a new emphasis on intense, uninhibited discussion of personal, family, and psychological struggles," making him famous.</p>
      <p><b>What are the poet's most important pieces?</b><br> Life Studies, a book he wrote, is constantly referenced throughout the wikipedia article on him, so it is probably important. Wikipedia also claims that it helped launch the confessional poetry movement.</p>
      <p><b>Was s/he friends with other poets (or influenced by other poets)?</b><br> He was influenced by his high school teacher who was also a famous poet, Richard Eberhart. He also met and became lifelong friends with Frank Parker, who was an artist, not a poet, who made the cover art for most of Lowell's books of poetry.</p>
      <p><b>Was s/he famous during his/her lifetime?</b><br> Yes. Wikipedia says "During the 1960s, Lowell was the most public, well-known American poet; in June 1967, he appeared on the cover of Time as part of a cover story in which he was praised as "the best American poet of his generation."[43][44] Although the article gave a general overview of modern American poetry (mentioning Lowell's contemporaries like John Berryman and Elizabeth Bishop), Lowell's life, career, and place in the American literary canon remained the article's focus."</p>
      <p><b>Extra Notes:</b>
      <ul>
        <li>His family, on both his parents' side, was full of prominent figures, but because of this, his parents were sixth cousins.</li>
        <li>He was surrounded by poets -- even his psychiatrist at Harvard was a poet.</li>
        <li>He travelled to Nashville to study at vanderbilt university for there was a specific professor there he wanted to study under. He asked if he could stay with that professor, who said that he could pitch a tent in his yard. He did exactly that.</li>
        <li>He refused to serve in World War II as a conscientious objector, saying that the war would result in the permanent destruction of Germany and Japan, due to the terms of unconditional surrender. He was willing to serve before he became aware of these terms.</li>
      </ul>
