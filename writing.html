      <h3>Writing Prompts</h3>
      <p>
        Select one writing prompt, complete it, and then follow the instructions
        under submission. In-class time <i>should</i> be enough time to complete
        any of the prompts, although for greater quality more time may be useful.
        Furthermore, all responses should be no longer than one page double space.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Response: </b>Select one of the poems on the left side, interpret it, and then write another poem to respond to the idea in the first poem you selected. Make sure to include a brief description of your interpretation of the first poem, with textual evidence.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Mimicing: </b>Select one of the two authors and write a poem mimicing their style, with a short paragraph explaining what you did to achieve that</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Comparison: </b>Select one poem from each author, and compare and contrast those poems in a explication-like format. Examine both large and small aspects of both poems.</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Mini-Explication: </b>Write a mini-explication of any poem on the left side of your choosing. Examine both large and small aspects of both poems.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Submission</h3>
      <p>
        When you finish your writing prompt, either convert it to a PDF and submit
        it using the first form with your Davidson email address, or submit it using
        the second form as a Google Docs link shared with davidjohnsonda@gmail.com.
