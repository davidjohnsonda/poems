      <h1>Morning</h1>
      <i>By Billy Collins</i>
      <pre>
  Why do we bother with the rest of the day,
  the swale of the afternoon,
  the sudden dip into evening,

  then night with his notorious perfumes,
  his many-pointed stars?

  This is the best--
  throwing off the light covers,
  feet on the cold floor,
  and buzzing around the house on espresso--

  maybe a splash of water on the face,
  a palmful of vitamins--
  but mostly buzzing around the house on espresso,

  dictionary and atlas open on the rug,
  the typewriter waiting for the key of the head,
  a cello on the radio,

  and, if necessary, the windows--
  trees fifty, a hundred years old
  out there,
  heavy clouds on the way
  and the lawn steaming like a horse
  in the early morning.
      </pre>
